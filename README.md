"There is strength in numbers my fellow DOGE brothers and sisters!" - An enjoyer of Dogecoin

According to coinbase, around 130 billion Dogecoins are in circulation, a testament to the influence the beloved cryptocurrency has amassed ever since its founding on 2013. (Of course the fact that 10,000 new DOGE are mined every minute does help boost that number but sematics, sematics). 

Anyways, what once started as a lighthearted joke by developers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer has turned into a massive community that has the power to brighten the day of anyone who is reminded of its legendary presence. From the countless memes to the collective effort to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Winter Olympics, Dogecoin has sparked both small and large positive change in many peoples's lives. DOGE has and will continue to serve as a ever-lasting landmark of cryptocurrency.
